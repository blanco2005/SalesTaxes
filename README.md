# SalesTaxes

## Assumptions

Here I list the assumptions I made to solve the assignment.

### Items

- The shelf price of an item is the price without taxes applied. I assumed the shelf price must be positive, i.e., it cannot be zero or negative.
- The description of an item must be a non-empty string.


### Rounding policy

- I assumed the rounding policy is specific for tax computation, i.e., I assumed that the amount to be rounded must be positive.

## Methodology

I solved the assignment by applying TDD (Test-Driven-Development).
