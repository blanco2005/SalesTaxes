# SalesTaxes

## Assumptions

Here I list the assumptions I made to solve the assignment.

### Items

The shelf price of an item is the price withot taxes applied. I assumed the shelf price must be positive, i.e., it cannot be zero or negative.

### Rounding policy

I assumed the rounding policy is specific for tax computation, i.e., I assumed that the amount ot be rounded must be positive.
