## Assumptions

Here I list the assumptions I made to solve the assignment.

### Rounding 

- The specification says to round up to the nearest 0.05. If the neighbours are equidistant, I assume to round up. Example: 0.875 is equidistant from 0.85 and 0.90; in such cases, I assume to round up (0.90 in this case).
